      <p>Income before transfers and taxes is market income plus social insurance benefits.</p>
      <p>Market income consists of labor income, business income, capital gains (profits realized from the sale of assets), capital income (excluding capital gains), income received in retirement for past services, and other sources of income. Social insurance benefits consist of Social Security Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits; Medicare benefits (measured as the average cost to the government to provide those benefits), and unemployment insurance benefits. </p>
      <p>Means-tested transfers consist of cash payments and in-kind transfers from federal, state, and local governments; the three largest means-tested transfers are Medicaid and the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program benefits (measured as the average cost to the government to provide those benefits), Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits (formerly known as Food Stamps), and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).</p>
      <p>Federal taxes consist of individual income taxes, payroll taxes, corporate income taxes, and excise taxes.</p>
      <p>Income after transfers and taxes is income before transfers and taxes plus means-tested transfers minus federal taxes.</p>
      <p>Income groups are created by ranking households by income before transfers and taxes, adjusted for household size. Quintiles (fifths) contain equal numbers of people; percentiles (hundredths) contain equal numbers of people as well.</p>
